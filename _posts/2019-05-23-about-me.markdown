Hi! I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at Fudan University, under the supervision of Prof. Xiangyang Xue and Prof. Yanwei Fu.

My research interests span face recognition, person re-identification and image generation.

I received my Bachelor's degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2017, under the supervision of Prof. Ying Li.
