Hi! I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at Fudan University, under the supervision of Prof. Xiangyang Xue and Prof. Yanwei Fu. 

I received my Bachelor's degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2017, under the supervision of Prof. Ying Li. 

My work focuses on face recognition, person reidentification and image generation.
